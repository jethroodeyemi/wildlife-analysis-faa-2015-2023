# Comprehensive Wildlife Strike Analysis Report

# Executive Summary

## Key Findings

- Strong seasonal pattern in wildlife strikes, with peak activity during migration seasons
- Identified 2 high-risk airports requiring immediate attention
- High damage rate (14.6%) indicates need for improved prevention measures
- Higher risk during specific flight phases: Approach, Climb, Descent
- Current warning systems show significant effectiveness in reducing incidents

## Priority Recommendations

- Adjust wildlife management strategies seasonally, with increased resources during peak periods
- Implement targeted risk mitigation strategies for high-risk airports
- Enhance aircraft protection systems and operational procedures in high-risk scenarios
- Enhance monitoring and prevention measures during identified high-risk flight phases
- Expand implementation of successful warning systems across more airports
